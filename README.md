#  Law-Chatbot
**Law-Chatbot** is a legal advisor AI model designed to answer law-related queries using vector embeddings and an LLM model. This project uses **Pinecone** for vector storage and **Groq's llama3-8b-8192** model for processing responses.

git clone https://github.com/Ved7738/Law-Chatbot.git
```
Move into the project directory:
```bash
cd Law-Chatbot
```

---

###  **Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv lawbot
```

Activate the environment:

###  **Step 3: Install the Project Requirements**
Install the project dependencies:
```bash
pip install -requirements.txt
```

---

###  **Step 4: Install the Project (Optional)**
Install the full project:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

###  **Step 5: Install Sentence Transformer Model from Hugging Face**
Download the **Hugging Face** embedding model:
- **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2**
- This model generates **384-dimensional embeddings**.

---

###  **Step 6: Set Up Pinecone for Vector Storage**
1. Go to [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) and create an account.
2. Create a new index with the following configuration:
   - **Dimensions:** `384`
   - **Metric:** `cosine`
3. Add your **Pinecone API key** to the environment variables or config file.

---

###  **Step 7: Create a Groq Account to Use Llama3-8b-8192 Model**
1. Go to [Groq](https://groq.com) and create an account.
2. Use the **llama3-8b-8192** model in your application.
3. Add your **Groq API key** to the environment variables or config file.

---

### **Step 8: Download the Dataset from Google Drive**
Download the dataset from Google Drive:  
 [Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iwhpGZ__NUcSC1eDyoslQOC5SyJO59-r?usp=drive_link)

1. Place the dataset files into the `/data` directory.
2. Ensure that your application reads and processes the dataset correctly.
